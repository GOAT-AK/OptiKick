# üìã OverView 

> _Ever worried if players are really getting the care they need to stay safe and perform their best?_ 

In the high-stakes world of competitive sports, even the smallest signs of fatigue, stress, or abnormality can lead to major injuries ‚Äî or worse. Inspired by real-life incidents involving athletes like Christian Eriksen and Ahmed Refaat, our project aims to provide a smarter, safer way to monitor athletes in real time.

This application combines **biometric tracking**, **AI-based injury prediction**, and **personalized training insights** to support athletes, coaches, and doctors in making proactive, data-driven decisions. Through wearable sensors, a powerful AI model, and a seamless mobile interface, we empower sports teams to detect early signs of physical overload, classify player states, and adapt training plans ‚Äî all in real time.



# Problem
Athletes today face numerous challenges that can significantly impact their performance, health, and career longevity. Our project addresses the following key problems:

**01. Intense Physical and Mental Demands:** Athletes constantly push their bodies to the limit, which can lead to fatigue, burnout, and decreased performance without proper support and monitoring.

**02. Gaps in Health Monitoring:** Traditional health assessments are periodic and reactive, missing early signs of serious conditions like cardiac arrhythmias or fatigue-related injuries.

**03. Lack of an Integrated System:** There is no unified platform that combines biometric monitoring, training feedback, and real-time risk detection in a seamless, user-friendly way.

**04. Fragmented Data Sources:** Athletes and coaches often rely on multiple disconnected tools and wearables, leading to incomplete or inconsistent data analysis.

**05. Increased Risk of Injury or Underperformance:** Without continuous monitoring and smart recommendations, athletes face higher risks of preventable injuries or suboptimal performance.

**06. Need for Personalized Training:** Most training programs are not tailored to the unique physical responses, recovery rates, and health status of individual athletes.



# Solution
Our application offers an AI-powered, athlete-centric platform that addresses key gaps in modern sports performance and safety. Here's how we solve the problem:

**01. Performance Tracking:** Biometric monitoring allows athletes and coaches to track performance metrics such as heart rate variability (HRV), exertion levels, and recovery status ‚Äî enabling smarter decisions during training and matches.

**02. Personalized Training:** Using machine learning models, the app tailors training recommendations based on each athlete's unique physiological data, helping to maximize output while reducing overload and fatigue.

**03. Injury Prevention:** By detecting anomalies in biometric signals early, the system can proactively alert coaches and medical staff to potential risks, helping to avoid serious incidents like those involving Christian Eriksen or Ahmed Refaat.

**04. Player Classification:** classify players into 4 categories `Optimal`, `At Risk`, `Recovering`, or `Underperforming` based on physical `readiness`, `Injury risk`, and `fatigue score` ‚Äî supporting team strategy, substitution decisions, and long-term development plans.

**05. Intuitive Interface:** Built with Flutter and designed in Figma, the user interface is clean, responsive, and easy to navigate ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre a coach, doctor, or athlete ‚Äî making complex data instantly understandable and actionable.



# why_It's_different
Unlike existing sports performance tools such as WHOOP, Polar Team Pro, Orreco, and Catapult ‚Äî which each offer only some isolated features ‚Äî our solution provides an all-in-one intelligent platform.

As shown in the table below, our system uniquely combines personalized training programs, AI-based player classification, intuitive design, injury risk prediction, and performance tracking into a single, seamless experience. This integration empowers coaches, doctors, and athletes to make smarter, safer, and faster decisions backed by real-time data and AI insights.

# UI

### üé® UI Identity & Design Inspiration

As part of building a modern and intuitive experience, we designed a visual identity that reflects both **our mission** and the **athletic context** of our application.

### üèÉ Logo Meaning

The logo depicts a dynamic athlete running toward a football ‚Äî representing **movement, agility, and precision**. The stylized lines behind the figure convey **speed and biometric motion tracking**, aligning directly with our system‚Äôs core:  
> _AI-powered performance tracking and injury prevention._

This symbol reflects not just sport, but **smart sport** ‚Äî where every movement is monitored, analyzed, and optimized through intelligent insights.

### üå± Color Choice & Background

We chose a **deep green gradient** as the background to mimic the **natural texture and tone of a football field**, instantly connecting the viewer to the athletic environment. This color also conveys:
- **Health & vitality** (green is often associated with wellness)  
- **Focus & professionalism**, with the darker tone ensuring contrast and clarity for data and charts  
- A calm, **non-distracting interface** that keeps athletes and coaches focused on what matters

This design direction ensures that the user interface is not only **aesthetically pleasing**, but also **purpose-driven** ‚Äî reinforcing the product's identity at every level.

# AI

- ### üìò AI Notebooks
  
   01. `Graduation_Check.ipynb`: *Data Validation & Exploration*
    
        This notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to ensure data readiness for training. Key tasks include:  
        - Detecting missing or inconsistent values
        - Exploring feature distributions
        - Visualizing data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
        - Removing Outliers

- #### Goal: Ensure clean & well-understood data before model training.
 
  02. `Graduation_All.ipynb`: *Model Benchmarking & Optimization*

       In this notebook, we compare six different ML models using `GridSearchCV` to get the best prameters for each one, `k-fold` to ensuring there's no overfitting, and evalueted these six models by **5 metrics** and `confussion matrix` to identify the best one. Key highlights:
        - Trains multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
        - Optimizes hyperparameters via grid search
        - Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC AUC

- #### Goal: Select the best performing model for real-world deployment      

  03. `Graduation_Main.ipynb`: *Final Training & Export*

       Here we train the final selected model using the optimal parameters and export it for use in an API:
        - Trains the chosen model on the full dataset
        - Saves both model and scaler as .pkl files
    
- #### Goal: Create production-ready model
  
<hr>

- ### üöÄ API Deployment

  We deployed the trained model using FastAPI, allowing real-time predictions from any interface (mobile, web, etc.).

 - #### üîß Local Setup

    To run the API locally:

     01. Navigate to the API folder
     02. Make sure the following files are present:
         - `ran_model.pkl` ‚Äì trained model
         - `scalar.pkl` ‚Äì scaler for preprocessing
         - `server.py` ‚Äì FastAPI app script

     03. Run the server using:
            ```bash
             uvicorn server:app --reload

     04. Open your browser and go to:

         >  *[Localhost](http://localhost:8000/docs)*  - to interact with the API via Swagger UI
 

           
 - #### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment (Live API)

    No installation needed ‚Äî test the API instantly via our live Railway deployment:

    01.  >  *[Our Live API](https://fastapi-predictorg-production.up.railway.app)*  

      You can input your biometric data directly through the web interface and get instant classification results
